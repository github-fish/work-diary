creat github page for WDL.   
download WDLTool and  SublimeText.   
test WDLTool with command:     
$ cd /Users/shuanglu/Documents/cromwell    
$ java -jar wdltool-0.14.jar.   
The installation of Cromwell itself is quite simple. The latest release can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases) in the form of a pre-compiled jar.     
For ease of use, you can also [add an environment variable to your terminal profile](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/set-environment-variable-linux/) pointing at the Cromwell jar file.    
Java 8
Cromwell requires Java version 8, which you can find [here](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/documentation/quickstart).    
Docker (optional).
